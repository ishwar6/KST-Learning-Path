Why we need any such system with us?

Our main objective is to prepare students to succeed in regular classes by helping them to deepen their understanding of the concepts, retain the material, and be confident in their learning ability.

1. Make students now more engaged because they should not feel that they are so far behind in a lesson. Make the system run with them.

3. A system and a platform which is web-based, artificially intelligent learning and
assessment system, uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows and doesn’t know within a course and within a chapter.

3. It then instructs the student on the topics they are most ready to learn. As a student works through a course, it periodically reassesses the student to ensure that topics learned are also retained.

4. If students feels difficulty then:  work through concepts they don’t understand using the system thorough explanations. And once they master the concept and move on, there is a great sense of accomplishment. Introducing Badges and reward at this point of time.

5. Display the data of each student:  A customised pie chart shows what the student knows and what the student has yet to learn. As the pie chart changes and the mastered portion grows, students can feel a sense of accomplishment in their progress and motivation in their learning.
